    <h4>4. RTOS and Web Technologies (AC Lab Software )</h4>

    <h4>5. VLSI and MEMS Research Lab (HDL Lab )</h4>
    <p>To excel in various aspects of microelectronics and VLSI, encompassing materials research, device development, molecular electronics, building complex digital and analog chips. To establish strong research links with industry in India and abroad, and to participate in national programmes for training manpower in VLSI</p>
    <p>The explosive growth in microelectronics—enshrined in Moore’s law—has fueled a revolution in the computer, communications, and consumer electronics industries. With the world semiconductor market estimated at US$ 319 billion, the semiconductor market will exceed the automobile market size by 2010.
    </p>
    <h4>VLSI Design & Technology
    </h4>
    <p>The VLSI project began in 1987 with the establishment of a VLSI Design Centre*, funded by the Department of Electronics, Government of India. The centre is now being supported by Intel Inc., US. Several chips have been designed at the Institute. This includes small-sized 3 and 5 micrometer nMOS test, and gate array chips designed for fabrication (including a radiation-hard gate array chip), as well as LSI/VLSI level chips. Most of the work has been on MOS, but some bipolar LSTTL chips have also been designed for commercial use, which are now being manufactured and marketed in India. Yet another achievement has been the commercial development of an Interconnect Capacitance Extraction Tool. To date, VLSI activities at IIT Bombay have received funding to the tune of over 10 crores from the Government of India and industries
